# React component library setup CLI

This repo is a CLI for creating a [React.js](https://reactjs.org/ "React.js") component library, using [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/ "typescript") (eg. \*.tsx files), [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/ "rollup") for bundling, ready for deploy on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/ "npm") with [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np "np"), featuring [Jest](https://jestjs.io/ "Jest") for testing as well as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/ "Next.js") and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/ "Storybook") for developing.

## Painfull process made extremely easy

```
$ yarn global add create-lib-react
```

then

```
$ create-lib-react
```

& follow the instructions

> ## Note
>
> I recommend using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/ "Yarn") but you can change any command to npm for eg.
>
> ```
> $ npm i -g create-lib-react
> ```
